DAT505 - Advanced Creative Coding Assignment Repo - Jasmine Price

This project is a day-night simulator where the user can click on the screen to change the time of day. The sun position will effect what happens in the environment. 

In the future I plan to finalise the model, lights, shadows etc. I will also give the option of setting the sun position to real time, and audio depending on the time of day.
