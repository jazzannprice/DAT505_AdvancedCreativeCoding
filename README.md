# Jasmine Price - DAT505 Advanced Creative Coding Project

The aim of the project was to create an engaging experience for an audience using Three.js. The direction I took was to develop an immersive artistic work that allowed the user to look around a 3D environment and visualise it in different states. These states being the time of day (position of the sun). When the user clicks the scene will change the time of day, allowing the user to interact and be engaged by the alternating environment.

- To use the project, open all the project files in Atom.

- Install the Atom-Live-Server into Atom and start running the server (within Packages).

- Once loaded the user can simply move their mouse around screen and the camera will follow, allowing a 360 vision of the scene.

- When the user left clicks the time of day will change (there are 4 possible states - day, dusk, night and dawn).
